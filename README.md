# DSAHW4

I basically just set up a repo here because I had 3 different versions of the assignment spanning two devices. So I decided that instead of copying one/multiple of the versions onto a thumb-drive just to drop it onto a different machine, I decided to just push everything to a git repo

- DSAHW3CS is actually this homework assignment, but in C#. I accidentally put 3 instead of 4 and was too lazy to change it
- The one that ends in "Swift" is obviously swift
- And the one where I didn't specify the language is primarily Kotlin with a java main method for ease-of-use

On the kotlin one, the program runs from Program2.java. I don't know why I left those starter files in there. But I neglected to take them out so they're there and just don't serve any purpose.

The DJSSet class is still in there. But I didn't really use it for anything. I just wanted to be able to quickly look at it occasionally to see what they did in the starter code. It was (sometimes) kind of helpful for coming up with ideas when I got stuck on something. Also thought it was funny it was almost syntactically identical in C# to the java version.
