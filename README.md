# DSAHW4

- DSAHW3CS is actually this homework assignment, but in C#. I accidentally put 3 instead of 4 and was too lazy to change it
- The one that ends in "Swift" is obvioudsly swift
- And the one where I didn't specify the language is primarily Kotlin with a java main method for ease-of-use

On the kotlin one, the program runs from Program2.java. I don't know why I left those starter files in there. But I neglected to take them out so they're there and just don't serve any purpos.
